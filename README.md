𝟯.𝗖𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀:
𝗖𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗳𝗳 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁: 5.9K
This indicates that certain routes may be consistently under or over the expected delivery time.

𝟰.𝗥𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
𝗥𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲: FTL (Full Truck Load)
This suggests that the majority of shipments are utilizing full truck loads rather than partial loads.

𝟱.𝗢𝗦𝗥𝗠 (Open Source Routing Machine) 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀

𝗢𝗦𝗥𝗠 𝗩𝗦 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲:
The graph likely shows a positive correlation, indicating that as the predicted time increases, actual delivery times also tend to increase.

𝗢𝗦𝗥𝗠 𝗩𝗦 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲:
Similar to the time analysis, this graph may depict a linear trend between the predicted and actual distances traveled.

𝟲.𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸:
𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻:
The average delivery times vary by day. A closer inspection is required to determine which days have the highest delivery times.

𝟳.𝗗𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸:
Thursday
Sunday
Friday
Wednesday
Monday
Saturday
Tuesday
It's crucial to focus on which days lead to delays or longer delivery times.

Carting
FTL (Full Truck Load)

𝟭𝟭.𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
Investigate Delayed Shipments:
Focusing on the 13.86% of delayed shipments can provide insights into bottlenecks in the delivery system.

𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘆𝘀:
Analyzing why certain days, such as Thursday and Sunday, may exhibit longer average delivery times can help in planning and resource allocation.

𝗘𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴:
Using OSRM data effectively can improve both predicted time and actual delivery efficiency
